## This homework covers properties of a size distribution of particles.
Use the first 8 pages in Chapter 8 of Seinfeld and Pandis to help you.

## 1. [10 pt] Integrating Lognormal Distribution

Consider a lognormal aerosol number size distribution with the following parameters:

* N = 3000 cm-3
* Dpg = 180 nm
* g_sigma = 1.8

Find the number of particles whose diameters are 180 nm < Dp < 400 nm.

 
## 2. [25 pt]  Lognormal Distributions

During a portion of a cruise in the North Atlantic, polluted air was encountered [Van Dingenen, R., F. Raes, and N. R. Jensen, Evidence for anthropogenic impact on number concentration and sulfate content of cloud-processed aerosol particles over the North Atlantic, Journal of Geophysical Research, 100, 21,057-21,067, 1995].  At this time, the aerosol size distribution was bimodal.  Van Dingenen et al. present the following lognormal parameters to describe the modes:

* N1 = 600 cm-3
* Dpg1 = 78 nm
* g_sigma1 = 1.5
* N2 = 1400 cm-3
* Dpg2 = 190 nm
* g_sigma2 = 1.5

a) [5 pt] Plot the total number size distribution on a log Dp scale from 10 nm to 10 nm diameter.

b) [3 pt] Calculate (don’t do this graphically) the volume median diameter of the larger mode.  

c) [5 pt] Plot the volume size distribution on another log Dp scale from 10 nm to 10 nm diameter.

d) [2 pt] Compare your answer from (b) to the plot from (c) to check your results.

e) [2 pt] Graphically from these plots, do you think the volume median diameter of the larger mode is a good approximation for the volume median diameter of the entire distribution?

f) [5 pt] Estimate the PM2.5 mass concentration.  You may do this numerically or graphically.  Assume a density of 1.5 g cm-3.

g) [3 pt] Find the number of particles with diameters smaller than 50 nm.


## 3. [15 pt] Fitting a Lognormal Distribution

Particles are lognormally distributed such that 8% of the number of particles have Dp > 3 microns, while 99.87% of the number of particles have Dp > 0.3 microns.  The total number concentration of particles is 100 cm-3.

a) [10 pt] Use the given information to fit a lognormal distribution to this data.

b) [5 pt] Find the surface median diameter.

# Project Report

## Overall

Think of this report as a short journal paper, more than a lab report but can be more informal (than a journal article) and discuss what you tried to do and what ended up working out.

## Requirements
On the order of 10-15 pages, with ~4 figures and references.

Ideally you would combine, your project proposal, your milestone 1 and 2 and revise them into a single document. (however we scraped milestone 2 so you'll have to write that part from scratch)

## Format

* Abstract
* Introduction
* Methods/Results
* Discussion

# Presentation

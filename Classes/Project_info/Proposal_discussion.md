## title: "Using Solar Energetic Protons to Monitor the Outer Magnetosphere"

## Proposal Abstract:
Decades of satellite missions have taught us much about the Earth's magnetosphere, but the high-latitude regions have rarely been measured
This critical region of our magnetic field is a primary layer of protection against harmful galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles (SEP)
Under the terms of a recent executive order, more than 167 satellite-years of high quality energetic particle data from Los Alamos Nat. Lab. instruments on the Global Positioning System have been publicly released, and a cross-calibration against an operational standard has just been completed
Where previous work has only been able to use single satellites in limited orbits, these multipoint data open the possibility of directly measuring the geomagnetic shielding from these particles in unprecedented detail all around the Earth
Using state-of-the-art particle tracing and an optimization methodology we will provide data-constrained estimates of the characteristics of important current systems
A key, unique capability afforded by this constellation of satellites is the simultaneous measurement of particle access over a range of latitudes and longitudes simultaneously
Combining this rich dataset with a novel modeling approach we will directly measure the particle access during SEP events at unprecedented resolution and use numerical simulations to estimate the characteristics of the most important current systems for geomagnetic shielding, including the poorly-observed magnetopause currents
This work will directly impact the safety of humans and technological assets by giving new insights into how particle access varies, as well as elucidating the formation of the high latitude magnetopause through enhanced understanding of the magnetopause properties.

## title: "Darcy-Feynman; Quantum Computing for Flow in Complex Fracture Networks"

## Proposal Abstract:

While many challenges remain, quantum computing has shown great promise for solving problems that no classical computer can feasibly solve
However, formulating scientific problems to take advantage of quantum computing remains elusive – details matter.
Quantum speed-ups have been excluded for many applications because larges systems of equations (where quantum computing excels) can often be replaced by small systems of equations while retaining the desired accuracy 3–a process called coarse-graining.
Simulating fracture systems, one of the most challenging problems in geophysics, is an ideal application for quantum computers because the multiscale nature of the problem makes coarse-graining impossible.
An extremely large system of equations is needed to accurately simulate a fracture system with a wide range of fracture sizes.
Our goal is to exploit quantum computing by apply in git to fracture systems while demonstrating the power of quantum computing in the geosciences.

In a complex fracture network, fractures of a wide range of sizes intersect.
The network's topology governs  fluid  flow  such  that  small  fractures  cannot  generally  be  neglected  because  these  can transform  the  network  topology  radically  (see  Fig.  1).
Small  fractures  may  also  collectively contribute a large surface area to the network providing a critical connection between fractures and the rock matrix.
For years, the holy grail of modeling flow in these networks has been to include the full range of fracture scales, which has led to the development of advanced meshing techniques and high-performance simulators5.
However, these approaches do not provide a viable path to modeling  the  full  range  of  scales.
Even  with  state-of-the-art  high-performance  computers, classical-computer  approaches  can  only  model  large  fracture  networks  with  fracture  lengths varying over three orders of magnitude.
The fundamental problem is that modeling networks with a wide range of fracture sizes produces an extremely large system of equations.
This system of equations is intractable for a classical computer but may be solved with a quantum computer.

## title: "Early Detection of Explosive Volcanic Eruptions Using VHF Radiation from Vent Discharges"

## Proposal Abstract:
Explosive volcanic eruptions produce ash plumes that can reach heights up to and beyond the cruising altitude of commercial air traffic (~10-12 km), posing a serious threat to airplanes
Ash that is ingested into a jet engine will melt and re-solidify onto the cooler engine components, leading to engine damage or failure
Volcanic ash can rise to aircraft cruising altitudes within 5 minutes of eruption onset, thus, timely detection of explosive eruptions and rapid characterization of the resulting ash cloud is a priority for volcano observatories around the world
At present, gaps in volcano monitoring capabilities lead to significant delays between eruption and warning of tens of minutes or more, particularly for remote volcanoes that are not covered by local monitoring networks
It is in the crucial early stages of eruption, before warnings have been issued, when the most hazardous encounters between ash and aircraft have the potential to occur
Furthermore, prompt characterization of the eruption cloud is needed to initialize ash transport and dispersion models that are run by volcanic ash advisory centers to forecast cloud movement. 
Right now, volcanic lightning detection is emerging as a desired capability for volcano observatories
Recent work has highlighted several important features of the electrical activity in volcanic plumes: (1) even very small ash plumes are electrically charged [1]; (2) the discharges evolve in predictable ways during plume development [2]; and (3) the discovery of event discharges [3, 4] demonstrates that electrical activity can be detected at the moment of eruption onset
Thus, detection of the electrical activity during an eruption offers a means to improve the state of the art in volcano monitoring
Our goal is to understand and characterize the radio frequency (RF) signature of vent discharges, which are unique to volcanic eruptions and not found in thunderstorms
This knowledge will enable design of a sensing system that exploits the characteristics of vent discharges to provide rapid detection and characterization of explosive volcanic eruptions.

## title: "Blurring the lines between Ocean parameterization and large eddy simulation"

## Proposal Abstract:
High fidelity ocean models are critical to numerous Department of Energy mission questions
However, current models of ocean turbulence are more than 20 years old
Modeling unresolved eddy motions in ocean simulations is particularly challenging because the physics of eddies at different scales vary dramatically
Furthermore, a push toward variable resolution models, led by the Los Alamos Nat. Lab. developed Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) Ocean, only increases the demands on our models
Within the variable resolution MPAS framework, models of unresolved physics must now smoothly adjust as more scales are resolved by the grid. 
Even current state-of-the-science representations of unresolved ocean physics, especially ocean turbulence, are considered dated in other communities
Recent developments in the aerospace or marine communities in Scale-Resolving Simulation (SRS) techniques [1-2] allow grid resolution to be placed only where needed, resolving only the motions of interest, smoothly transitioning to a model for the rest of the domain
Here we propose a collaboration, bringing together two important areas of unique expertise at Los Alamos Nat. Lab, by extending SRS techniques to MPAS-Ocean, radically improving its fidelity and efficiency.  

From the oceans impact on sea ice distributions in the Arctic and its effects on shipping lanes, to coastal erosion and inundation, to sequestration of CO2 from the atmosphere to the deep ocean, the Department of Energy requires high fidelity ocean models to answer mission critical questions
However, accurate simulation of the ocean is particularly difficult because it includes important physical processes occurring at scales ranging from millimeters to many kilometers (Fig. 1).

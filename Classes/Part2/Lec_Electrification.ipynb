The exact conditions and mechanism by which a graupel might be charged negatively, and smaller cloud particles charged positively, have been a matter of debate for some hundred years. Many potentially promising mechanisms have been proposed but subsequently found to be unable to explain the observed rate of charge generation in thunderstorms or, for other reasons, found to be untenable."

    "\n",
    "If the graupel grows more slowly by vapor deposition than the ice crystals, the graupel receives negative charge and the ice crystals receive the corresponding positive charge. Because the latent heat released by the freezing of supercooled droplets on a graupel as it falls through a cloud will raise the surface temperature of the graupel above ambient temperatures, the rate of growth of the graupel by vapor deposition will be less than that of ice crystals in the cloud. \n",

    "Consequently, when an ice crystal rebounds from a graupel, the graupel should receive a negative charge and the ice crystal a positive charge, as required to explain the main distribution of charges in a thunderstorm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The charge transfer appears to be due to the fact that positive ions move through ice much faster than negative ions. As new ice surface is created by vapor deposition, the positive ions migrate rapidly into the interior of the ice, leaving the surface negatively charged. \n",

    "During a collision material from each of the particles is mixed, but negative charge is transferred to the particle with the slower growth rate.\n",
